# Building Inventory System

# Features

## Building, Room, Container, and Item Nesting
BIS allows users to create buildings, rooms, containers, and items which are nested inside each other to allow for easy navigation and logical storage.

## Item Statistics and Tracking
BIS allows users to see an items price and quantity history, as well as basic statistics of each, giving an easy to  understand representation of items over time. 

## Sharing and Collaboration
BIS allows users to share buildings with other users with either view or manager permissions, allowing others to either view or edit buildings and their nested objects, respectively.

## Browse Page
BIS allows users to browse through a list of public pages, allowing public buildings to be discovered by users of the site.
